# jQuery Calculator

This is a basic calculator that you can use to sum, divide, substrac, multiply and find the exponential value of two sets of numbers. It works like any calculator would, the user selects a first number, selects an operator, a second number and then gets the result. 

## Technology used

This web based application uses jQuery as a JavaScript library. We also used Bootstrap for the design and container layout and some minor CSS editing.
